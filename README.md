# üí≥ Banking Microservices Project

This is a backend microservices-based banking system built with Spring Boot and Docker. The system simulates a basic banking platform with functionalities like user management, account operations (credit, debit, transfer), transaction history, and inter-service communication via an API Gateway and service discovery with Eureka.

### ‚úÖ Microservices:
1. **API Gateway**
   - Routes external client requests to microservices
   - Service discovery through Eureka
   - Will support JWT-based auth (future enhancement)

2. **User Service**
   - Create and manage user profiles
   - Spring Security configured (open endpoints currently)
   - Connected to PostgreSQL

3. **Account Service**
   - Create, credit, debit, rollback, and view account info
   - Transaction rollback logic included
   - Connected to PostgreSQL

4. **Transaction Service**
   - Records credit, debit, and transfer operations
   - Uses Feign client to communicate with Account Service
   - Logs transaction history

5. **Eureka Server**
   - Service registry and discovery
   - Enables load-balanced communication
